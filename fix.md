"What should I upload next?"

Enhance the output to be structured, actionable, and strategy-driven.

Requirements:

1. The response must include the following sections:

## 1. Performance Signal Interpretation
- Compare 7-day vs 28-day retention.
- Explain what the improvement actually means.
- Avoid generic phrases like "promising" or "good".
- Translate metrics into content behavior insights.

## 2. Strategic Direction
- Identify what format or theme is currently performing better.
- Explain whether the channel should double down or experiment.
- Make a clear strategic recommendation (no neutrality).

## 3. Specific Next Video Recommendation
Provide:
- Exact video concept
- Why it aligns with current retention trend
- Emotional angle (curiosity, nostalgia, surprise, humor, etc.)

## 4. Hook Optimization
Provide:
- Example first 5-second script
- What visual should appear immediately
- What problem or promise is introduced instantly

## 5. Title Ideas (3 Options)
Generate 3 high-click titles optimized for:
- Curiosity gap

- Keyword discoverability

## 6. Thumbnail Direction
Describe:
- Facial expression (if applicable)
- Text on thumbnail (max 4 words)
- Color contrast suggestion
- Visual focal point

## 7. Format Recommendation
State clearly:
- Short or Long-form
- Ideal duration
- Why this duration aligns with retention data

## 8. Measurable Goal
Define:

The response must feel like a content strategist advising a creator — not a generic AI summary.

When analytics data is available, the system must:
- Explicitly reference the numeric delta (e.g., +7.71%)
- Convert numeric shifts into content interpretation
- Never repeat metric values without explaining impact
